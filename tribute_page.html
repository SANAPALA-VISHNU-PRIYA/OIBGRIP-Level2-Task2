     <p><i>Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, India—died April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam), Indian mathematician whose contributions to the theory of numbers include pioneering discoveries of the properties of the partition function.<br>
    When he was 15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr’s Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, 2 vol. (1880–86). This collection of thousands of theorems, many presented with only the briefest of proofs and with no material newer than 1860, aroused his genius. Having verified the results in Carr’s book, Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems and ideas. In 1903 he secured a scholarship to the University of Madras but lost it the following year because he neglected all other studies in pursuit of mathematics.<br>
    Ramanujan continued his work, without employment and living in the poorest circumstances. After marrying in 1909 he began a search for permanent employment that culminated in an interview with a government official, Ramachandra Rao. Impressed by Ramanujan’s mathematical prowess, Rao supported his research for a time, but Ramanujan, unwilling to exist on charity, obtained a clerical post with the Madras Port Trust.<br>
    The Indian government, on February 26, 2012, declared December 22 as National Mathematics Day. Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh made the declaration during a visit to the Madras University for paying tributes to Ramanujan on his 125th birth anniversary. On this occasion, Dr Singh also announced that 2012 would be celebrated as the National Mathematics Year.<br>
    Since then, December 22 every year has been observed as National Mathematics Day in honour of Ramanujan’s achievements. On this occasion, numerous educational events are held at schools and universities. In 2017, the day’s significance was enhanced by opening the Ramanujan Math Park in Kuppam, in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh.</i></p>
